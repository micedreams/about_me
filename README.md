## Why you think you are a great fit for the position
## Tell me somethinh good about previous project
There was this whole phase when I was asked to add missing features
as in polishing existing features, according to requriments.

where I fixid:
#### 1. Sign in
##### Requrments
1. Sign in using OTP
2. Sign in using password
##### Things that was alredy there when I first started working with the code
1. sign in form (both forms)
2. sign in with password form (did not work on mobile app)
3. input fields that took input and checked with back end DB
4. sign in with password/otp button (depnding on which form it was in)
5. redirect buttons did not work

##### Everything that was missing that I helped fix
1. functon to check if mobile or email was registerd
2. adding functionality to redirect buttons
3. sign in using emial/mobile number and password(on mobile app)
4. stay in the same page and show user readable errors if wrong email/mobile number or password was entered (insted of going to an error page)
 -  wrong email or password could be 1. wrong password, 2. email not registered, 3. mobile not registered.
 
 #### 2. Sign up
 I wrote code to make sure the mobile number and email entered while registration was unique (this was really a side fix because it was taking me to an error page while signing in if there were more than one account registered with same mobile or email entry in the database)
 
## why was it good
it was really cool experience because it gave me the sense of giving to the end user what I expect as an end user.
